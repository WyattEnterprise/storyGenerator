### **üë¢Epic 1: Development Environment & Bootstrapping**

### **üß± Feature 1: Project Structure & Toolchain Bootstrapping**

**Goal**: Establish a clean foundation for both frontend and backend projects, with consistent tooling and structure for TypeScript development across both, containerized in Docker, and runnable inside WSL2.

---

#### **User Story 1.1 ‚Äî Set Up Folder Structure for Frontend and Backend Projects**

**Description**  
 As a developer, I want to scaffold a `frontend` and `backend` folder using the recommended file structures so that all team members start with consistent organization and know where to add new code.

**Context**  
 This will enable Claude Code Sonnet Max to work efficiently across separated domains. Each folder should include an initial `README.md`, placeholder `src/` structure, and project-specific tooling configs.

**Acceptance Criteria**

* A root `project/` folder contains:

  * `frontend/` with `src/components/`, `src/pages/`, `src/hooks/`, etc.

  * `backend/` with `src/modules/`, `src/middlewares/`, `src/utils/`, etc.

* Each has:

  * A `README.md` describing purpose and entry point

  * A placeholder `index.tsx` (frontend) and `index.ts` (backend)

  * Empty `.gitkeep` or starter files in core folders

* Folder structure matches the diagrams provided

**Implementation Notes**

* Use functional React structure for frontend with TypeScript

* Backend should assume Worker-based setup but mimic Express layering

* Claude Code should use `mcp.context7.fs()` to scaffold directories and write boilerplate files

---

#### **User Story 1.2 ‚Äî Create and Configure `tsconfig.json` for Frontend and Backend**

**Description**  
 As a developer, I want to configure strict TypeScript settings in both the frontend and backend so we ensure type safety and clear developer expectations.

**Context**  
 We are using Context7 MCP and Sonnet Max to generate code. Enabling strict mode and common compiler options ensures early type checking and better autocompletion.

**Acceptance Criteria**

* `tsconfig.json` exists in both `/frontend` and `/backend`

* Includes:

  * `"strict": true`

  * Module resolution for Node/ESNext

  * Path aliasing with `baseUrl: "./src"` (optional but helpful)

* No compiler warnings/errors on initial startup

**Implementation Notes**

* Use MCP context API: `mcp.context7.fs().writeTsConfig(...)`

* Add example interfaces in `/types/` to validate settings

* Use consistent `include`/`exclude` settings: exclude `node_modules`, `build`, etc.

---

#### **User Story 1.3 ‚Äî Configure ESLint and Prettier with TypeScript Support**

**Description**  
 As a developer, I want both ESLint and Prettier set up with TypeScript plugins so that all code written is consistent and automatically formatted.

**Context**  
 This keeps Claude‚Äôs output clean and makes diffs readable for human developers.

**Acceptance Criteria**

* `.eslintrc.js` or `.eslintrc.cjs` in both frontend and backend

* `.prettierrc` or config block in `package.json`

* Linting works with `npx eslint .`

* Formatting works with `npx prettier --check .`

* Both support `.ts`, `.tsx`, and modern syntax

**Implementation Notes**

* Use recommended ESLint config for TypeScript:

  * `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`

  * `eslint:recommended`

* Claude should use `mcp.context7.npm().installDev(...)` to install plugins

---

#### **User Story 1.4 ‚Äî Add Basic Yarn 4 Workspaces and Volta Configuration**

**Description**  
 As a developer, I want to use Yarn 4 with Volta pinning to lock down our node and tooling versions and use Yarn workspaces to manage monorepo tooling.

**Context**  
 This helps Claude Code and human devs keep tool versions stable and ensure dependencies are fast and shared when appropriate.

**Acceptance Criteria**

`package.json` in root enables Yarn workspaces:

 json  
CopyEdit  
`{`  
  `"workspaces": ["frontend", "backend"]`  
`}`

*   
* `.yarnrc.yml` enables Plug'n'Play and sets nodeLinker

`volta` field in root `package.json` pins:

 json  
CopyEdit  
`"volta": {`  
  `"node": "20.10.0",`  
  `"yarn": "4.0.2"`  
`}`

*   
* Running `yarn install` in root installs deps for both projects

**Implementation Notes**

* Use `mcp.context7.cmd()` to run `yarn init`, `yarn set version berry`, etc.

* Document version pinning in root `README.md`

* Add `.yarnrc.yml` with `nodeLinker: node-modules` if PnP causes friction

---

#### **User Story 1.5 ‚Äî Create a Shared `.env.example` and Config Pattern**

**Description**  
 As a developer, I want a shared `.env.example` file and reusable config pattern in both projects so everyone knows what secrets/configs are needed without checking in real keys.

**Context**  
 We will use PostHog, RevenueCat, Firestore, etc. This lets Claude Code prompt for the right keys at runtime and ensures portable environments.

**Acceptance Criteria**

* `.env.example` exists in both `frontend/` and `backend/`

* Lists keys for:

  * `REVENUECAT_KEY`, `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, etc.

* `dotenv` or equivalent loads it

* Add `.env` to `.gitignore`

* Add `config/` folder with one example loader (`config/index.ts`)

**Implementation Notes**

* Claude Code will later prompt user for values

* For frontend, recommend using `expo-constants` or `expo-env` abstraction

---

#### **User Story 1.6 ‚Äî Dockerize Frontend and Backend Projects**

**Description**  
 As a developer, I want to run both frontend and backend in Docker containers so that I don't need to set up Node or dependencies manually in my WSL environment.

**Acceptance Criteria**

* `frontend/Dockerfile` builds Expo app in development mode

* `backend/Dockerfile` runs wrangler or cloudflare-worker-dev server

* `docker-compose.yml` runs both services, exposes ports, mounts volumes

* Instructions in root `README.md` for `docker-compose up`

**Implementation Notes**

* Use `mcp.context7.fs().writeDockerfile()` to scaffold base images

* For frontend: use `node:20`, mount volume, expose 8081 or 19000

* For backend: use `wrangler`, watch for changes

---

#### **User Story 1.7 ‚Äî Add GitHub Actions CI for Lint \+ Type Checks**

**Description**  
 As a developer, I want CI checks for both frontend and backend to lint code and ensure types are valid so that no one merges broken code.

**Context**  
 Claude Code should lint and type-check each PR. We'll add EAS Build & Deployment later.

**Acceptance Criteria**

* `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on PRs and pushes

* Runs:

  * `yarn lint`

  * `yarn type-check`

* Separate steps for `frontend` and `backend`

* Fails if there are TypeScript or lint errors

**Implementation Notes**

* Claude Code will use `mcp.context7.github().writeWorkflow(...)`

**Description**  
 As a developer, I want to chunk the returned story into \~250-word pages and generate image prompts for each using DALL¬∑E 3 so each page gets an illustration.

**Context**  
 The Worker should emit requests to DALL¬∑E, one per page, and stream results back via WebSocket.

**Acceptance Criteria**

* `image.service.ts` splits story and queues image jobs

* Each page has: `text`, `imagePrompt`, `imageUrl`

* DALL¬∑E requests sent one at a time

* Progress events are sent back to client

**Implementation Notes**

* Claude: use `mcp.context7.worker().sendImageJobs(...)`

* Use `R2` for final image URLs

* Requires `DALL_E_API_KEY` (TODO)

---

#### **User Story 3.6 ‚Äî Integrate Firestore for Story Metadata**

---

#### **User Story 2.1.3 ‚Äî Lock All App Routes Without Auth**

**Title**  
 Restrict App Navigation Until Parent Is Logged In

**Description**  
 As a developer, I want to ensure that no parts of the app are accessible unless the user is authenticated so we remain COPPA/GDPR compliant.

**Context**  
 This protects character data, story creation, and child info from being exposed prior to consent and login.

**Acceptance Criteria**

* All non-authenticated users see only:

  * Welcome screen

  * Auth flow

* Authenticated users see:

  * Consent screen

  * Then rest of app

* Auth guard works on deep links and reloads

**Implementation Notes**

* Claude: use `mcp.context7.routing().wrapNavigationGuard()`

* Create `AuthContext` in `src/context/` using Firebase listener

* Add HOC or hook: `useAuthGuard()`

* Write test for guard logic and fallback

---

#### **User Story 2.1.4 ‚Äî Store Parent UID and Session Locally**

**Context**  
 Firebase provides automatic session persistence but we want to ensure UID is available in `AuthContext`.

**Acceptance Criteria**

* `AuthContext` exposes `parentUID` after login

* App restores session after reload

* If expired, automatically redirects to login screen

**Implementation Notes**

* Claude: use `mcp.context7.state().createAuthContext()`

* Use `onAuthStateChanged` from Firebase to hydrate context

* Save UID to `AsyncStorage` for fallback if needed

* Show loading spinner while session is restored

### **üìÑ Feature 2: COPPA/GDPR Consent Enforcement**

**Goal**: Present a compliant consent flow on first app launch after login. Require parent consent before allowing child profile creation or story generation. Trigger Apple ‚ÄúAsk to Buy‚Äù / Google Family approval before image upload.

**Description**  
 As a developer, I want to prevent access to story creation, profiles, or settings until the parent has agreed to the consent terms.

**Context**  
 We must guarantee that no child data is handled unless consent is given.

**Acceptance Criteria**

* All app routes except Welcome and Consent are gated

* If `consentGiven` is false or missing, redirect to ConsentScreen

* On logout, consent flow restarts on next login

**Implementation Notes**

* Claude: extend `AuthContext` to include `hasConsent` flag

* Write helper: `useConsentGuard()` similar to `useAuthGuard()`

* Add unit test and mock consent document in test Firestore emulator

---
