# ðŸ‘¥ User Personas

Understanding our users drives every backlog item. Each persona is a **fictional but evidenceâ€‘based archetype** that captures needs, frustrations, and goals.

| Persona | Bio & Context | Goals | Pain Points |
|---------|---------------|-------|-------------|
| **Casual Story Reader** | 28â€‘yearâ€‘old who enjoys reading short fantasy stories on mobile during commutes. | Quick entertainment, share cool stories with friends. | Long waits; clunky mobile UX. |
| **Creative Parent** | 35â€‘yearâ€‘old parent who generates bedtime stories featuring their child as the hero. | Safe, childâ€‘appropriate content; voiceâ€‘over playback. | Complex UI; difficult exporting. |
| **ESL Educator** | English teacher in Spain using story generation to create custom reading exercises. | Adjustable difficulty; multilingual support. | Lack of translation accuracy; missing worksheets. |
| **Indie Game Writer** | Solo dev prototyping lore ideas via generated narratives. | Rapid iteration; export raw text. | Character limits; vendor lockâ€‘in. |
| **Accessibility Advocate** | Blind user relying on screen readers. | Full a11y compliance; descriptive alt text. | Missing labels; nonâ€‘keyboardâ€‘friendly dialogs. |

Use these personas when writing acceptance criteria and designing UI flows.
