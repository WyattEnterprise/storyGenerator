# Updated User Story 2.3 - Professional React Native Development Setup

## Original User Story 2.3 (REPLACED)
~~**User Story 2.3 — Dockerize Expo App for Dev in WSL2**~~

**Why Docker was removed**: Docker creates networking complexity for React Native development, breaks hot reloading performance, and interferes with device connectivity. Industry best practice is native development environment.

## New User Story 2.3

#### **User Story 2.3 — Setup Development Environment with EAS CLI and Testing**

**Title**  
Configure Professional React Native Development Workflow

**Description**  
As a developer, I want to set up EAS CLI, development scripts, and testing infrastructure so I can build and test the app efficiently following React Native best practices.

**Context**  
Instead of Docker (which creates networking issues for React Native), we'll use industry-standard native development with professional tooling for builds, testing, and device debugging. This provides better performance, reliability, and device connectivity.

**Acceptance Criteria**

* Install and configure EAS CLI for cloud builds
* Add development scripts for device testing (`yarn ios`, `yarn android`, `yarn tunnel`)
* Set up testing infrastructure with Jest and React Native Testing Library
* Configure environment for WSL2 + Windows development
* Document device connection setup for iPad/iPhone testing via QR codes and tunnel mode
* Add environment configuration for development variables

**Implementation Notes**

* Install `@expo/cli` and `eas-cli` globally for professional development
* Add `.easrc` configuration for project settings
* Create development scripts in package.json for tunnel mode and device testing
* Set up Jest configuration for React Native testing with proper mocks
* Document networking setup for physical device testing (QR codes, tunnel mode, LAN access)
* Add `.env.example` for Expo development environment variables
* Configure VSCode settings for optimal React Native development

**Professional Benefits**
- Faster development cycle (no container overhead)
- Better debugging experience with direct device connectivity
- Industry-standard workflow matching React Native best practices
- Reliable hot reloading and Metro bundler performance
- Simplified device testing via Expo Go app

## Implementation Plan

1. **EAS CLI Setup**: Configure cloud build service
2. **Development Scripts**: Add device-specific launch commands
3. **Testing Infrastructure**: Jest + React Native Testing Library
4. **WSL2 Configuration**: Optimize for Windows development
5. **Device Testing**: Document QR code and tunnel workflows
6. **Environment Variables**: Professional configuration management

This replacement provides significantly more value than Docker setup and aligns with React Native industry standards.
