# User Story 1.1 — Set Up Folder Structure for Frontend and Backend Projects

## Description
As a developer, I want to scaffold a `frontend` and `backend` folder using the recommended file structures so that all team members start with consistent organization and know where to add new code.

## Context
This will enable Claude Code Sonnet Max to work efficiently across separated domains. Each folder should include an initial `README.md`, placeholder `src/` structure, and project-specific tooling configs.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] A root `project/` folder contains:
  - [x] `frontend/` with `src/components/`, `src/pages/`, `src/hooks/`, etc.
  - [x] `backend/` with `src/modules/`, `src/middlewares/`, `src/utils/`, etc.
- [x] Each has:
  - [x] A `README.md` describing purpose and entry point
  - [x] A placeholder `index.tsx` (frontend) and `index.ts` (backend)

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Structure
```
frontend/
├── README.md
└── src/
    ├── index.tsx
    ├── components/
    ├── pages/
    ├── hooks/
    ├── utils/
    └── types/
```

### Backend Structure
```
backend/
├── README.md
└── src/
    ├── index.ts
    ├── modules/
    ├── middlewares/
    ├── utils/
    └── types/
```

## Files Created
- `frontend/README.md` - Frontend documentation with purpose and entry point
- `frontend/src/index.tsx` - React application entry point
- `backend/README.md` - Backend documentation with purpose and entry point  
- `backend/src/index.ts` - Hono application entry point
- `src/features/1.1-folder-structure-setup/` - Feature directory structure following atomic design

## Next Steps
The scaffolded structure is ready for development. Team members can now:
1. Add components to the appropriate frontend directories
2. Implement backend modules and middleware
3. Follow the feature-first architecture pattern for new features
